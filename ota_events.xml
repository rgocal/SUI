<text>GSD Mobile, a new application of mine launched yesterday. This chrome powered application is a mobile signature of my website GocalSD. In this application, I will be using it's newsfeed to announce new products, promotions and information regarding development and new projects like Sapphyx Launcher. The Sapphire Launcher newsfeed will only retain information related to the project and not anything regarding promotions or un-related. Their howevor will be hints to check out the Google Plus Group for any promotion based event but nothing will be announced in this section. Thank you for time!</text>

<newsitem headline="Update 11.4 Schedule *Updated*">
<text>A recent failure do to the Windows10 Anniversary update has caused problems with my Ubuntu workstation dualboot and has delayed this update further more. The Windows update formatted and removed the Ubuntu partition in my desktop thus delaying development.  Luckily backups were made and no data was lost. 11.4 update will roll out silently when its ready, thank you for understanding and apologies for any inconvenience. 11.4 will also open string translation to community members on github. More information as that becomes available. </text>
