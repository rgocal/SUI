<newsitem headline="Record Breaking Revenue">
<text>You guys have broken the record of Premium license purchased for the month. This is excellent news! Keep it up! This revenue will be invested in upgraded equipment for my Android Workstation which desperately needs it for the new projects coming. Without these upgrades, these projects won't be possible. THANKYOU!</text>

<newsitem headline="Thankyou">
<text>This phrase says it all. The two years that some of you have fully been dedicated means so much to me as a developer. You will soon see the light of a sequal in the new year. A revised and more powerful launcher is in the works for Android 6.0+. Sapphire Launcher EX is coming in 2017.</text>
