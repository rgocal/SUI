Lets start with the rewards. 
Premium License Passes grant you access to all of my premium apps on Google Play. 
Basic License Passes allow you to dodge ads and donation dialogs in some of my applications that allow for a license key to be targeted. 

Complete a full translation for your favorite or desired language and submit it and acquire a Premium License Pass after the patch has been sumbitted and accepted in a Google Play update (And promising to keep up with any changes) 
Complete more than one language and you will recieve a Basic License Pass promotion code you can claim yourself or hand out to friends and followers. 

After completing a language translation or updating a supported language in Sapphire Launcher, you may request a push here on github or send me the trasnlated string folder via dropbox or google drive via hangouts or email (you can acquire my email from Google Play). Translations will be pushed to source in incremental updates on google play and xda labs.

If multiple users take on the translation task, you will be mentioned in Sapphire Launcher credits to get your name out in the world as thanks for contributing. 

You have a base folder to start with so good luck and thankyou for contributing!
